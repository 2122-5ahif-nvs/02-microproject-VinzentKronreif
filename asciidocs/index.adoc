== Description
We had to implement a REST-Service with the CRUD-functionalities. The endpoints are tested via http-requests in the request file. Endpoints work with Json and Xml and are documented with Swagger.

My microproject is about a Ski Rental Service. You can rent a pair of ski and pay per day.
